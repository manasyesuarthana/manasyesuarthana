### About Me

I'm a (future) developer who is passionate in **DevOps**, **Software Development**, and **Cybersecurity**.

I'm constantly diving into new technologies and sharpening my skills. When I'm not coding, you'll find me competing in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions.

- 🌱 My current focus is on deepening my knowledge on **Software Engineering, DevOps Tools, and Secure Development** (and also grind leetcode + CTFs on the side :v)
- 💬 Feel free to ask me anything about **Linux**, or how to get started in **Cybersecurity**.
- 🚀 My learning roadmap includes: **CI/CD Pipelines, AWS, Jenkins, Kubernetes, IaC through Terraform, System Design** with an additional focus of **System Security**.
